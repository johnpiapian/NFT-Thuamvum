# NFT-Thuamvum
This is a personal Spring Boot backend project with the yet-to-be-determined front-end. 
The primary purpose of the project is to learn more about Spring Boot and perhaps create something
fun and interesting in the process. It can also be used as a starter project for future project ideas.

## Technology Stack
**Front-end**: Possibly React/Nextjs with Tailwind or Bootstrap. <br/>
**Back-end**: Spring boot and REST api. </br>
**Database**: Postgresql <br/>
